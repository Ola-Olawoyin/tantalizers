## Bugs

+ ### Solved bugs
    1. The home page image was not properly aligned and was appearing to large on larger sceens
    
        *Solutions:* A max width set in 80% ensured image is at maximum of 80% of screen size.
    
    2. Textareas in the booking page accepted infinite characters.
        
        *Solution:* I included maxlength attribute to restrict the allowable length of characters. 

    3. Accordion in the menu page could be opened but not closed
        
        *Solution:* I changed the input type from radio button to checkbox, allowing user to voluntarily open and close.
    
    4. Images used are to heavy and are causing performance failure
       
        *Solution:* I compressed the images for more efficiency.

+ ### Unsolved bugs
    - Booking date can be in the past, yet a confimration message is displayed. This would require other technologies like Javascript to fix.
    - Email and Confirm Email fields may differ yet a confimration message is displayed. This would also require other technologies like Javascript to fix.

+ ### Mistakes
    - Mistakes were made while committing changes. I commited some unrelated changes and I wasn't able to include adequate commit messages.
    - While progressing in my code I learned to commit relatable changes.

---

## Future improvements
- Make confirmation message personalised and dynamic.
- Fully functional table booking form
